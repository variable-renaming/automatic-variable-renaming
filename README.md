  - CSV Files: Each file contains multiple columns: methodBody, methodTokens, methodIndex, extractedVars, extractedFrom. Some of those files, also contain extra columns mainly useful for keeping track of general statistic
  - Model-Specific-Dataset: For each one of the experimented model, we created a specific (train,test and eval dataset) based on the aforementioned CSVs

  - Here, you can find the model we trained and made it publicly available

  - Under this folder you will find all the predictions concerning the experiment

  - The code for training and testing the model is available here

  - Under this path, we also relase extra scripts we used for the experiment. (e.g; the java typename ids resolver)
